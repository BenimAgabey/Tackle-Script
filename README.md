Note: I don't have much of a clue what I'm doing, so yeah...

Short and simple standalone script for FiveM generated entirely by ChatGPT.
I made this because I couldn't find a tackle script for free on the FiveM forum (maybe I'm blind), but this took like, 10 minutes, and a couple more to test it out. I thought I'd share it, considering how it's technically not mine, you can do whatever you want with it, just please don't 'resell' it anywhere else.

P.S: Yes, I don't have a license on it because it's just a bunch of words to me, you can do what you want to it.
